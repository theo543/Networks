Step 1
Routers, Switches, Hubs, Wireless Devices, Security, WAN Emulation
There are 15 end devices.
There are 13 intermediary devices.
8 end devices are not desktop computers, assuming laptops do not count as desktop computers.
There are 4 connection types - serial, coaxial, copper, and wireless.

Step 2
a)
In the client-server model, there are server and client devices.
A server device provides services to client devices, receiving inbound connections.
A client device requests services from server devices, initiating outbound connections.
The client-server model fits protocols such as HTTP(S), where client request resources from servers, but not peer-to-peer protocols.
b)
Functions of intermediary devices:
- Send and receive packets across different networks, perform Network Address Translation to allow hosts to connect without a public IP address - routers.
- Send and receive frames within one network - switches.
- Filter connections to block unauthorized traffic - hardware firewalls.
- Provide wireless connection to a network - Wireless Access Point, home routers are usually also Wireless Access Points
- Transmit and receive data through an analog audio connection - modems.
c)
Criteria to choose a media type:
- Bandwidth - how much data it can transmit at once?
- Latency - how quickly it can transmit data?
- Price - how much does it cost?
- Is supported by the existing devices in the network?
- Ease of Installation - How easy is it to install?
- Resilience - What is the expected time before this connection breaks? (if it breaks a lot, the network will need more redundancy, may increase costs)

Step 3
a)
A LAN is a small network which only connects hosts within one location, such as a company building, a home office, a university, etc.
A WAN is a large network which extends over a large area, such as multiple company buildings, a neighborhood, or even an entire city.
The Internet is a WAN.
b)
2 - The Internet, and the Central + Branch office, since they are connected through an intranet (unlike the Home Office LAN, which has to go through the Internet to connect to the company)
c)
3 - The Home Office, Central, and Branch.
d)
The Internet is a massive network which connects almost every other network on Earth. It allows quick access servers on distant networks, even on the other side of the Earth.
e)
- Mobile Data, i.e. 5G, 4G, etc.
- Dial-Up connection, through a phone line.
- Satellite connection, using an antenna
- Optic fiber broadband connection
f)
Businesses generally use the same technologies as home users to connect to the internet, but there are some differences:
- Large businesses may have a dedicated, high-capacity connection to their ISP.
- Businesses may purchase public IPv4 IPs to be able to host public Internet services. Home connections often do not have public IPs (if Carrier-Grade NAT is used), or have dynamic IPs (which require dynamic DNS to host a service from).
- Small businesses use a shared network, which many businesses share and pay for, to reduce their costs. These connections will likely have worse bandwidth, but small businesses may not need more.
