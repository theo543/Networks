Part 1
Step 1
c) The East router has USB, Console, AUX, and Ethernet cables, built-in to it. It also has a WAN interface card which provides two serial ports.
Step 2
a) There are two Ethernet ports and two serial ports, so the router should have four physical interfaces.
b) The command listed four physical interfaces.
c) GigabitEthernet 0/0 has 1000000 kilobit bandwidth. Serial 0/0/0 has 1544 kilobit bandwidth.
Step 3
a) The East router has one free slot for additional modules.
b) Switch2 and Switch3 both have five free slots.

Part 2
Step 1
a) The HWIC-4ESW can be used to connect the PCs to the router. Up to four hosts could be connected, since the module provides four switching ports.
b) The PT-SWITCH-NM-1FGE can be used to provide a Gigabit Ethernet optical connection.
Step 2
a,b) I turned off the East router and added the module.
c) I added the modules to the switches.
d) The command shows a GigabitEthernet 5/1 interface. Since the slots start from zero, this is the sixth slot from the right.
e) I added a HWIC-2T to the slot on the right to provide a serial connection, and covered the left slot.
f) The command shows two new serial interfaces, in addition to the built-in Ethernet ones.
