Part 1

Step 1
126 hosts in a /25 subnet
80 hosts in total in the topology diagram
6 subnets needed

Step 2
Largest: BR1 LAN
40 hosts required
/26 subnet mask
62 host addresses in a /26 subnet
Yes, subnet 192.168.33.128/25 into two /26 subnets
Result:
192.168.33.128/26 - allocated to BR1 LAN
192.168.33.192/26

Step 3
Second largest: BR2 LAN
25 hosts required
/27 subnet mask
30 host addresses in a /27 subnet
Yes, subnet 192.168.33.192/26 into two /27 subnets
Result:
192.168.33.192/27 - allocated to BR2 LAN
192.168.33.224/27

Step 4
Third largest: BR2 Iot LAN (Future)
5 hosts required
/29 subnet mask
6 host addresses in a /29 subnet
Yes, subnet 192.168.33.224/27 into four /29 subnets
Result:
192.168.33.224/29 - allocated to BR2 Iot LAN (Future)
192.168.33.232/29 - allocated to BR2 CCTV LAN (Future)
192.168.33.240/29 - allocated to BR2 HVAC C2LAN (Future)
192.168.33.248/29

Step 5
Fourth largest: BR1-BR2 Link
2 hosts required
/30 subnet mask
2 host addresses in a /30 subnet
Yes, subnet 192.168.33.248/29 into two /30 subnets
Result:
192.168.33.248/30 - allocated to BR1-BR2 Link
192.168.33.252/30 - unused

Reflection Questions:
Can you think of a shortcut for calculating the network addresses of consecutive /30 subnets?
Since they will be 4 apart, just calculate the first network address, then add 4 repeatedly to get all the others.
