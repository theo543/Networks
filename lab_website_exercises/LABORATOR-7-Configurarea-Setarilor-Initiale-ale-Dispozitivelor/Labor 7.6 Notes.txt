Part 2
Step 1
c) Because the router needs to be configured first.
Step 2
n) The pings were successful.

Part 3
Step 1
a)
C indicates a directly connected network.
There are two directly connected route entries.
The C coded routes are associated with GigabitEthernet0/0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/0/1.
Step 2
a)
GigabitEthernet0/0/1 is up.
The MAC address is 0060.4731.8102
The internet address is displayed as 192.168.1.1/24, so in decimal notation, with the prefix length

Reflection Questions
1.     If the G0/0/1 interface showed that it was administratively down, what interface configuration command would you use to bring the interface up?
no shutdown
2.     What would happen if you had incorrectly configured interface G0/0/1 on the router with an IP address of 192.168.1.2?
There would be conflict with S1, also the default gateway of S1 and PC-A would be incorrect.
PC-A would be unable to communicate with S1, the router, or hosts on external networks such as PC-B.
