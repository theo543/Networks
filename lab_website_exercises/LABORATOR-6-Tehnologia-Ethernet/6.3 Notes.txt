Part 1
Step 2
e)
There are ND PDUs present because the sender did not know the receiver's MAC address.
ND PDUs are the IPv6 equivalent of ARP requests in IPv4.
f)
Message Type: 128
g)
The destination IP changed to a multicast address FF02::1:FF00:B
The layer two addresses are the sender's MAC address and a multicast MAC address:
0001.427E.E8ED > 3333.FF00.000B
h)
There is no change at Layer 2. The switch did not change the source and destination MAC addresses.
i)
Ethernet II DEST ADDR: 3333.FF00.000B
Ethernet II SRC ADDR: 0040.0BD2.243E
IPv6 SRC IP: 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::B
IPv6 DEST IP: FF02::1:FF00:B
j)
Because RTA is not the target of the NS message, RTA does not respond.
Because multicast is not routed across networks, RTA does not forward the message to the other network.
Therefore, there is no output from RTA.
l)
Yes. The only information needed to communicate with a host on the local network is the destination IPv6 and MAC address.
m)
TYPE: 0x81
o)
Because 'Reset Simulation' did not clear PCA1's NDP cache, so it did not need to ask for the MAC address again.

Part 2
Step 1
f)
Src. IP: FE80::201:42FF:FE7E:E8ED (link-local)
g)
0001.961D.6301 (RTA, GE 0/0/0)
i)
The source and destination MAC addresses are missing. (because PCB1 needs to send a NS request to RTA)
m)
No.
n)
The destination MAC address corresponds to RTA (GE 0/0/1).
PCB1 is using RTA's MAC address because PCA1 is not on the same network, so it needs to send the packet to the default gateway.

Step 2
b)
Four addresses.
They correspond to PCA1 and PCB2. Each device has a link-local and a global address.
There are no entries for PCA2, because the router never needed to send a packet to it, so it never learned its MAC address.
d)
Yes. There is now one entry for PCA2, mapping its global address to its MAC address.

Reflection Questions
1.     When does a device require the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery process?
When it wants to send a packet to a local host, but it does not know the MAC address corresponding to the destination IPv6 address.
Or when it wants to send a packet to a remote host, but does not know the gateway's MAC address.
2.     How does a router help to minimize the amount of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery traffic on a network?
Like all IPv6 devices, routers keep a neighbor table to minimize ND traffic.
Routers are also responsible for not forwarding multicast ND messages to other networks.
3.     How does IPv6 minimize the impact of the ND process on network hosts?
IPv6 ND uses special IPv6 and Ethernet multicast addresses called solicited-node multicast addresses.
These addresses contain the last 24 bits (i.e. last 6 hex digits) of the destination IPv6 address.
This allows IPv6 devices to automatically filter out most ND messages by checking the destination address.
Since IPv6 addresses tend not to have identical last 24 bits, the chance of collision is low.
This can be done in hardware, though in the Packet Tracer simulation, it seems to be done by the NDP process.
Multicast filtering is also done by switches, via devices informing the switch of the multicast groups they are interested in
(they are required to join their solicited-node multicast group, so they can reliably receive ND messages meant for them)
1.     How does the Neighbor Discovery process differ when a destination host is on the same LAN and when it is on a remote LAN?
When a destination host is on the same LAN, the Neighbor Discovery process is used to find its MAC address.
Otherwise, the Neighbor Discovery process is used to find the default gateway's MAC address.
