The ports which are down are not connected to anything.
The switches are connected using ports F0/1 on each switch.
One PC is connected to F0/6 on S1, and another on F0/18 on S2.

A ping could fail if either PC had an issue with the connection to the switch, or if there was an issue with the connection between the switches.
