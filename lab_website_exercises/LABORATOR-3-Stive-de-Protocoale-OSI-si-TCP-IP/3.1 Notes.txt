Step 2
The web browser is now displaying a page saying "Web Server - You have successfully accessed the home page for the Web Server."

Step 3
b)
"Layer 7: HTTP"
"1. The HTTP client sends a HTTP request to the server."
c)
Dst Port: 80
d)
Dest. Ip: 192.168.1.254
e)
It displays the Ethernet header - source and destination MAC address.
f)
IP: The source IP and destination IP, associated with Layer 3.
TCP: The source port and destination port, associated with Layer 4.
HTTP: The host listed is www.osi.local, this would be associated with Layer 7.
h)
The source and destination ports, IPs, and MACs have been swapped.
i)
"Connection: close"
j)
There are only two tabs, because this device is not sending back a HTTP response (it is the client), so there is no Outbound PDU Details tab. 

Part 2

Step 1
b)
The additional Event Types are DNS, ARP and TCP.

f)
4. The TCP connection is successful.
5. The device sets the connection state to ESTABLISHED.
g)

Challenge

The Web Server is listening on TCP port 80 for HTTP requests.
The Web Server is listening on UDP port 53 for DNS requests.
