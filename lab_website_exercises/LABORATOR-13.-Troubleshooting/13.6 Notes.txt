Part 2

PC-A has no default gateway.

Can't connect to the switch. SVI is likely misconfigured.
Used a console cable to connect to switch and checked startup-config
VLAN 1 interface is administratively down and default gateway does not match addressing table.
Those issues can't affect connection speed, but should be fixed to not cause confusion in the future.
Interface FE0/5 is set to half-duplex and speed is 10.
This is likely the cause of the slow speed.

There is no route to 209.165.200.226.
The ISP should be the gateway of last resort.

Part 4
Configured PC-A default gateway.
Fixed incorrect default gateway on switch.
Enabled SVI on VLAN 1.
Set connection to full duplex speed 100 from both switch and router.
Set gateway of last resort to 10.1.1.2 on router.
